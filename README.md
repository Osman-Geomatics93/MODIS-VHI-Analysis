# MODIS-Based Vegetation Health Analysis for Sudan

## Overview
This script processes MODIS satellite data to assess vegetation health conditions across Sudan by integrating:
- NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from MOD13A1 product
- Land Surface Temperature (LST) from MOD11A2 product

## Indices Calculated
1. VCI (Vegetation Condition Index)
   - Normalizes NDVI to assess relative vegetation changes
   - Range: 0-100%

2. TCI (Temperature Condition Index)
   - Evaluates temperature stress impact
   - Converts LST from Kelvin to Celsius
   - Range: 0-100%

3. VHI (Vegetation Health Index)
   - Combined measure of vegetation and temperature conditions
   - Equal weights of VCI and TCI
   - Range: 0-100%

## Features
- Automated data processing for year 2000
- Custom visualization with interactive legend
- Color-coded output (blue to red palette)
- Export functionality to Google Drive
- AOI-specific analysis for Sudan

## Class Ranges
- 0-25: Low vegetation health
- 26-50: Moderate vegetation health
- 51-75: High vegetation health
- 76-100: Very high vegetation health

Would you like me to expand on any of these aspects or add additional technical details?
